The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you are trying to access is not available yet. This can happen if you are trying to access data from a listener before the data has been fully loaded.  For example, if you have a listener that is triggered when data changes, but you try to access the data before the listener has been triggered, you may encounter an error.

```javascript
db.ref('users').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  // This code might error if the snapshot is not yet populated
  console.log(snapshot.val().name);
});
```
