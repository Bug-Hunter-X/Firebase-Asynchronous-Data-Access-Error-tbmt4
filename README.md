# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase development: attempting to access data before it has fully loaded asynchronously.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. 

## Problem

Firebase data retrieval is asynchronous.  If you try to access data immediately within a listener or after a database operation without waiting for the completion, you might encounter unexpected errors, such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous patterns to ensure the data is available before attempting to access it. This usually involves Promises or async/await.
